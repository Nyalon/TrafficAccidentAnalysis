# USA Traffic Accident Analysis

My team took on the challenge of analyzing traffic accident data across the usa. Below are the questions we wanted to answer based on our analysis. 

- What locations nationally and locally have a greater severity of traffic accidents? 
- Which, if any, weather events lead to an increase in traffic accidents?
- What times of the day are traffic accidents most prevalent? 
- Does the presence of precipitation indicate a greater severity of traffic accidents?

#### Analysis is based on accidents that occured in 2018 located in the USA

## Conclusion and Findings

- Accidents are most likely to occur during the day however accidents during the night have a higher chance of being more severe. 
- Major US cities, including those in Raleigh, have a greater frequency of traffic accidents. 
- Nationally, the most severe accidents follow the major highways. Locally, the most severe accidents occur on the beltline and at major. 
- Regardless of what part of the day the accidents occurred, the presence of certain types of precipitation (rain, snow, and fog) indicated a greater severity of accidents.
